    "* `argmax`: find the argument (index) producing the maximum value. `argmin` is the same but for the minimum value. [Doc](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.html)\n",
    "* `copy`: make a copy of an array. [Doc](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.copy.html)\n",
    "* `fill`: fill an array with a value. [Doc](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.fill.html)\n",
    "* `flatten`: turn a multi-dimensional array into a single-dimensional version. [Doc](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.flatten.html)\n",
    "* `linspace`: return a set of evenly-spaced numbers as an array (more consistently than `arange`). [Doc](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html)\n",

    "**The purpose of a plot is to provide evidence or support for a claim you make.** So for example, suppose that you have two swings, one of which is rusty, and claim that the rusty swing stops earlier than the other. You could conduct an experiment to analyze this: sit the same person on each swing in turn, start them forward of center, and release them, tracking their distance from the normal hanging center of the swing over time. Then, saying that the blue plot represents the position of the person in the more rusted swing over time gives more credibility to your claim.\n",

As we can see, the rusty swing shows a clear decrease in the distance from the center over time, with the peak distance at less than 50cm from the center at 1 second.

    "The above figure shows the distance between a given set of airports \"as the crow flies\". Before making the plot, I believed the distance between a set of airports would be proportional to the length of a flight between them. As shown in this plot, however, the distance between a given set of airports (plotted in red) appears to be almost randomly correlated to the length of a flight between them (plotted in translucent blue). While the data loosely aligns, outliers like OGG to DEN throw the perceived alignment off."

Interestingly, the maximum x-value of each of the first three files is 14, while the last file's maximum x-value is 19. Also curiously, the mean and standard deviation of the x-values and y-values of all of the datasets are consistently the same. While we don't know whether or not these datasets are correlated, this may be an indicator of a relationship between them. At this point, we could try to do more analysis, but I think it would be more useful to plot the data and see what happens:"
